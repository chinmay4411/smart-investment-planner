A balanced investment portfolio typically allocates funds across different asset classes to reduce overall risk and maximize returns. The 100-minus-age rule suggests that the percentage of equity investments should be 100 minus your age, with the rest in debt instruments.

For moderate-risk investors (age 30-50), a common strategy is 40% in equity mutual funds/SIPs, 30% in debt funds/FDs, 20% in direct stocks, and 10% in gold/REITs. This provides growth potential while maintaining stability.

High-risk investors (young professionals under 35) can allocate 60-70% to equity instruments, 20-30% to debt, and 10% to alternative investments. This aggressive approach aims for higher returns but comes with greater volatility and requires longer investment horizons.

Conservative investors (over 50 or risk-averse) should focus on capital preservation with 60-70% in FDs/bonds, 20-30% in debt funds, and only 10-20% in equity for inflation protection.

Asset allocation should be regularly reviewed and rebalanced annually or when there's a 5-10% deviation from target allocation. Rebalancing ensures the portfolio stays aligned with the investor's risk tolerance and financial goals.

Diversification across asset classes (equity, debt, gold, real estate), sectors (technology, healthcare, finance), and geographies (domestic and international) helps protect against market downturns and ensures more stable growth over time.

The key is to start early, invest regularly through SIPs, and maintain discipline during market volatility. Time in the market beats timing the market, making systematic investing more effective than trying to predict market movements.
