Risk management is crucial for successful investing and involves understanding different types of risks and how to mitigate them.

Market risk affects all investments and cannot be eliminated, but can be reduced through diversification across different asset classes, sectors, and geographies. This is why a balanced portfolio with stocks, bonds, and other assets is recommended.

Credit risk applies to debt investments like bonds and FDs. To minimize this, invest in high-rated instruments (AAA-rated bonds, government securities) and diversify across multiple issuers.

Liquidity risk refers to the difficulty of selling an investment quickly without significant loss. Maintain an emergency fund equivalent to 3-6 months of expenses in liquid instruments like savings accounts or liquid mutual funds.

Inflation risk erodes purchasing power over time. Equity investments historically provide better inflation-adjusted returns than fixed deposits, making them essential for long-term wealth preservation.

Interest rate risk affects bond prices inversely - when rates rise, bond prices fall. This is why shorter-duration bonds are less risky than long-term bonds in a rising rate environment.

For young investors, the biggest risk is not taking enough risk early in their career. With 30+ years to retirement, they can afford market volatility and should focus on growth assets like equity mutual funds.

Conservative investors should prioritize capital preservation but still need some equity exposure (10-20%) to beat inflation over the long term. The key is finding the right balance between risk and return based on age, income stability, and financial goals.

Regular portfolio rebalancing helps maintain the desired risk level as market movements can change the actual allocation from the target allocation. This disciplined approach reduces emotional decision-making and improves long-term returns.
