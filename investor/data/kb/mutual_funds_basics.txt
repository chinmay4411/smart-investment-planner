Mutual funds pool money from multiple investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities. They are managed by professional fund managers.

Investors can choose between equity funds, debt funds, or hybrid funds depending on their risk appetite and investment goals. Equity funds are high-risk/high-return, while debt funds are low-risk/low-return.

SIPs in mutual funds allow disciplined, periodic investing, which helps investors manage market volatility effectively. Lump-sum investments can be riskier in volatile markets.

Mutual funds provide liquidity, diversification, and professional management, making them suitable for beginners and those who want hands-off investing.
