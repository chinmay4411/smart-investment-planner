Stocks represent ownership in a company and provide investors with the opportunity to earn dividends and capital gains. Stock investments are more volatile but offer higher returns over the long term.

Investing in stocks requires analyzing market trends, company performance, and sector growth. Long-term investors can benefit from compounding and price appreciation.

Diversification is crucial when investing in stocks. By investing in multiple companies or sectors, investors can reduce risk associated with a single company or market segment.

Stocks are suitable for investors with high-risk tolerance and long-term investment horizon. Short-term investors should be cautious as stock prices fluctuate frequently.
