Fixed Deposits (FD) provide guaranteed returns over a fixed period and are considered low-risk investments. The interest rates are stable and offer financial security for conservative investors.

Systematic Investment Plans (SIP) invest in mutual funds periodically. SIPs allow investors to benefit from rupee-cost averaging, reducing the impact of market volatility over time.

FDs are suitable for short-term goals or emergency funds, whereas SIPs are better for long-term wealth creation. While FDs preserve capital, SIPs have higher growth potential but come with market risk.

Investors should balance their portfolio between FD and SIP depending on their risk tolerance, age, and financial goals. Conservative investors should allocate more to FD, while moderate or high-risk investors can invest more in SIPs.
