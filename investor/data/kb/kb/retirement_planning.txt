Retirement planning involves setting aside funds during your working years to ensure financial security after retirement. It is important to start early to benefit from compounding.

Investment options for retirement include PPF, EPF, NPS, mutual funds, and stocks. The choice depends on risk tolerance, expected retirement age, and income level.

A good retirement strategy involves a mix of safe, low-risk investments for stability and higher-risk investments for growth. Reviewing the plan every few years is crucial.

Contributing regularly, even in small amounts, ensures steady wealth accumulation. Avoid withdrawing retirement funds prematurely to maximize growth potential.
