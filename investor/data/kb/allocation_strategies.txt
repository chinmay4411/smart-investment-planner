A balanced investment portfolio typically allocates funds across different asset classes to reduce overall risk. For moderate-risk investors, 50% in FDs or bonds, 30% in stocks, and 20% in SIPs is a common strategy.

High-risk investors can allocate a higher percentage to stocks and SIPs, reducing allocation to FDs. This approach aims for higher returns but comes with greater volatility.

Asset allocation should be regularly reviewed and adjusted based on age, financial goals, and market conditions. Rebalancing ensures the portfolio stays aligned with the investor's risk tolerance.

Diversification across asset classes, sectors, and geographies helps protect against market downturns and ensures more stable growth over time.
